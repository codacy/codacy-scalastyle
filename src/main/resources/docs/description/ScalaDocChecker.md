It is important to provide documentation for all packages, classes, traits, methods, and other members.

The general format for a ScalaDoc comment should be as follows:

    /** This is a brief description of what's being documented.
      *
      * This is further documentation of what we're documenting.  It should
      * provide more details as to how this works and what it does.
      */
    def myMethod = {}
