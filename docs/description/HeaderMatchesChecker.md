# Header Matches

A lot of projects require a header with a copyright notice, or they require a license in each file. This does a simple text comparison between the header and the first lines of the file. You can have multiple lines, but make sure you surround the text with a `CDATA` section. You can also specify a regular expression, as long as you set the regex parameter to `true`.
